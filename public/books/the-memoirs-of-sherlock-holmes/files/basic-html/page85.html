    <pre style="white-space:pre-line"><code>Wilson, the sham chaplain, knocked one of them in, and pulled out a dozen of
               brown sherry. We cracked off the necks of the bottles, poured the stuff out into
               tumblers, and were just tossing them off, when in an instant without warning
               there came the roar of muskets in our ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke
               that we could not see across the table. When it cleared again the place was a
               shambles. Wilson and eight others were wriggling on the top of each other on

               the floor, and the blood and the brown sherry on that table turn me sick now
               when I think of it. We were so cowed by the sight that I think we should have
               given the job up if it had not been for Prendergast. He bellowed like a bull and
               rushed for the door with all that were left alive at his heels. Out we ran, and
               there on the poop were the lieutenant and ten of his men. The swing skylights
               above the saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us through
               the slit. We got on them before they could load, and they stood to it like men;

               but we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes it was all over. My
               God! Was there ever a slaughter-house like that ship! Prendergast was like a
               raging devil, and he picked the soldiers up as if they had been children and
               threw them overboard alive or dead. There was one sergeant that was horribly
               wounded and yet kept on swimming for a surprising time, until some one in

               mercy blew out his brains. When the fighting was over there was no one left of
               our enemies except just the warders, the mates, and the doctor.

                   “‘It was over them that the great quarrel arose. There were many of us who
               were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who had no wish to have
               murder on our souls. It was one thing to knock the soldiers over with their
               muskets in their hands, and it was another to stand by while men were being
               killed in cold blood. Eight of us, five convicts and three sailors, said that we

               would not see it done. But there was no moving Prendergast and those who
               were with him. Our only chance of safety lay in making a clean job of it, said
               he, and he would not leave a tongue with power to wag in a witness-box. It
               nearly came to our sharing the fate of the prisoners, but at last he said that if
               we wished we might take a boat and go. We jumped at the offer, for we were
               already  sick  of  these  bloodthirsty  doings,  and  we  saw  that  there  would  be
               worse before it was done. We were given a suit of sailors’ togs each, a barrel

               of  water,  two  casks,  one  of  junk  and  one  of  biscuits,  and  a  compass.
               Prendergast threw us over a chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners
               whose  ship  had  foundered  in  lat.  15º  N.  and  long  25º  W.,  and  then  cut  the
               painter and let us go.

                   “‘And now I come to the most surprising part of my story, my dear son.
               The seamen had hauled the foreyard aback during the rising, but now as we

               left them they brought it square again, and as there was a light wind from the
               north and east the barque began to draw slowly away from us. Our boat lay,
               rising and falling, upon the long, smooth rollers, and Evans and I, who were
               the  most  educated  of  the  party,  were  sitting  in  the  sheets  working  out  our</code></pre>
