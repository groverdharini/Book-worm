    <pre style="white-space:pre-line"><code>“‘I  thought  you  were  the  brokers,’  said  she,  ‘we  have  had  some  trouble
               with a tradesman.’

                   “‘That’s  not  quite  good  enough,’  answered  Forbes.  ‘We  have  reason  to
               believe that you have taken a paper of importance from the Foreign Office,
               and  that  you  ran  in  here  to  dispose  of  it.  You  must  come  back  with  us  to
               Scotland Yard to be searched.’


                   “It was in vain that she protested and resisted. A four-wheeler was brought,
               and we all three drove back in it. We had first made an examination of the
               kitchen, and especially of the kitchen fire, to see whether she might have made
               away  with  the  papers  during  the  instant  that  she  was  alone.  There  were  no
               signs, however, of any ashes or scraps. When we reached Scotland Yard she
               was  handed  over  at  once  to  the  female  searcher.  I  waited  in  an  agony  of
               suspense  until  she  came  back  with  her  report.  There  were  no  signs  of  the
               papers.


                   “Then for the first time the horror of my situation came in its full force.
               Hitherto  I  had  been  acting,  and  action  had  numbed  thought.  I  had  been  so
               confident of regaining the treaty at once that I had not dared to think of what
               would be the consequence if I failed to do so. But now there was nothing more
               to be done, and I had leisure to realize my position. It was horrible. Watson
               there would tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy at school. It is my

               nature.  I  thought  of  my  uncle  and  of  his  colleagues  in  the  Cabinet,  of  the
               shame which I had brought upon him, upon myself, upon every one connected
               with  me.  What  though  I  was  the  victim  of  an  extraordinary  accident?  No
               allowance is made for accidents where diplomatic interests are at stake. I was
               ruined, shamefully, hopelessly ruined. I don’t know what I did. I fancy I must

               have  made  a  scene.  I  have  a  dim  recollection  of  a  group  of  officials  who
               crowded round me, endeavouring to soothe me. One of them drove down with
               me to Waterloo, and saw me into the Woking train. I believe that he would
               have come all the way had it not been that Dr. Ferrier, who lives near me, was
               going down by that very train. The doctor most kindly took charge of me, and
               it was well he did so, for I had a fit in the station, and before we reached home
               I was practically a raving maniac.


                   “You  can  imagine  the  state  of  things  here  when  they  were  roused  from
               their beds by the doctor’s ringing and found me in this condition. Poor Annie
               here and my mother were broken-hearted. Dr. Ferrier had just heard enough
               from  the  detective  at  the  station  to  be  able  to  give  an  idea  of  what  had
               happened, and his story did not mend matters. It was evident to all that I was
               in for a long illness, so Joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom, and it
               was turned into a sick-room for me. Here I have lain, Mr. Holmes, for over

               nine weeks, unconscious, and raving with brain-fever. If it had not been for
               Miss Harrison here and for the doctor’s care I should not be speaking to you</code></pre>
